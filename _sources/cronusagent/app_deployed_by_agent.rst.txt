Deploy Application 
=======================

This guide describes how to deploy an application directly through agent REST API without cronusmaster

**Requires:**

* Cronus packaged application HTTP accessible by agent on target machine 

**How:**

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -k -X POST -d '{"package": ["{cronus_package_url}"], "manifest": "{manifest_name}", \
   "env": "{env}", "daemon": "upstart|systemd"}' \
   https://host:19000/services/{service_name}/action/deploy 

   # service_name: mandatory service name
   # cronus_package_url: mandatory url location to your cronus package 
   # manifest_name: optional manifest name, default to use cronus package version
   # env: optional env value, used to select environment specific application configurations
   # daemon: optional daemon manager, used to launch applications managed by upstart or systemd

**Expected Outcome:**

* Service is created if not already exist
* Manifest is created if not already exist
* Any existing active manifest is shutdown, deactivate
* New manifest is install, activate, and startup
